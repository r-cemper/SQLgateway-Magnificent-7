# SQLgateway-operating-Caché-IRIS #  
Sample example to show how to communicate between InterSystems Caché and     
InterSystems IRIS **using SQLgateway** in contrast to other types of linking.        
Migration is the most attractive functionality in SQLgatway and it is easy to visualize.    
But it also offers a broader range of non-permanent linking of databases.   
e.g. centralized error tracking.  
### Warning ###
This is just JDBC/Java and IRIS with ISOS and SQL 
- no AI, no Python, no other magic
 
## Credits ##
Inspired by the previous packages provided by [YURI MARX PEREIRA GOMES](https://openexchange.intersystems.com/user/YURI%20MARX%20PEREIRA%20GOMES/QKGV1uPuZml09uNsC8bNKcRQj8)
this is a logical follower.  
And the [official documentation on SQLgateway](https://docs.intersystems.com/iris20261/csp/docbook/Doc.View.cls?KEY=BSQG_overview)
uncovers more useful features.


## Prerequisites
Make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [Docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed.    
In order to allow networking with Caché you need an appropriate license.  
Caché works by default with a single user and no networks.
Add it and enable copy in cache/Dockerfile

## Installation 
Clone/git pull the repo into any local directory
```
git https://github.com/r-cemper/SQLgateway-migration-cache-IRIS.git
```
1. Build
```
docker-compose build
```
2. Run it in foreground. Sometimes container start is slower than estimated.  
```
docker-compose up
```
  - Wait for confirmation from your containers container:  **ready to accept connections**
  - The first pull for DB2 may take quite some time for the upload

3.   **Connection to CACHÈ**: 
        - host: container cache 
        - database: SAMPLES 
        - port: 1972
        - username: _SYSTEM
        - password: SYS
        - SMP: http://localhost:51772/csp/sys/UtilHome.csp
        
4.   **Connection to IRIS**: 
        - host: localhost 
        - namespace: user 
        - port: 41773 
        - username: _SYSTEM 
        - password: SYS
        
5. **SQLgateway**  
   is installed during Docker build and the required   
   jdbcdriver for Linux is included in this repo   
   
## How to test ##
SMP is available here 
     http://localhost:42773/csp/sys/UtilHome.csp    
     
All migration actions can be executed directly from SMP.   
1. Verify the gateway connection in    
   SMP> Administration> Configuration> Connectivity> SqlGateway_Configuration    
 ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r-cemper/SQLgateway-migration-cache-IRIS/master/docs/gty01.jpg) 
   - To test Connection click **edit** for connection **CACHE**     
   - verify  **Connection successful**      
   - Be patient at this point. Some DB containers take quite some time to talk to you.   
     wait a little bit, reload the page in browser and try the test again. 
   
2. Identifying the source tables. In SMP > Change to Namespace USER   
  then step to SMP >Explorers >SQL >Wizards > Data Migration   
  ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r-cemper/SQLgateway-migration-cache-IRIS/master/docs/gty04.jpg)
  
3. Set required import parameters  
 
  -  Destination Namespace = USER  
  -  Type = TABLE   
  -  Select a SQL Gateway connection: = CACHE  ; now the first connection is established 
  -  and you select Schema = SAMPLES  
  -  Tables to migrate:  The namespace has a lot of cross-referencing tables 
     I suggest loading the Samples.* package tables first 
  
4. Identifying new targets is possible, but may cause conflicts in cross-references 
   This is one key to success:   
   Tables get listed alphabetically not by logical dependency or sequence. 
   This could cause errors.  

5. Skipping special settings, we use defaults to start the task in background      
  ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r-cemper/SQLgateway-migration-cache-IRIS/master/docs/gty07.jpg) 
  
6. Now check the results and see if everything was working without Errors  
   You might see errors if tables depend on content not yet migrated.   
   And wait for completions until the status shows **Done** 
  
7. We terminate the Migration Wizard and return to the normal table view 
   All tables are visible and show meaningful columns and contents
  
8. Selecting a table and clicking on **OpenTable** shows reasonable contents   
  
9. A look into the related generated Class Definitions confirms the result and successful completion.
